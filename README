scalacsv - A CSV parser in Scala

Simple, easy to use, hopefully correct.

Parsing from a string:

  scala> val rows = CSV.fromString("foo,bar\nfoz,baz")
  rows: Vector[Vector[String]] = Vector(Vector(foo, bar), Vector(foz, baz))

Parsing from a file:

  scala> val rows = CSV.fromFile("foo.csv")
  rows: Vector[Vector[String]] = Vector(Vector(foo, bar), Vector(foz, baz))

Includes tests against files exported from Google Docs and Excel 2008 for Mac.
Please send me short test files from any other programs you want supported.
